\subsection{Uniform Cost}

Based on the results presented in Chapter \ref{}, it can be seen that Bounded Waste is the choice of algorithm for reordering when the input sequence alternates or is random. For input sequences that come in fixed sized blocks, BW fails to achieve a good performance for small buffers, in these cases Round Robin or Random Choice algorithms can be used and Bounded Waste can be used when the buffer sizes are significantly larger than the block size. 


Recommend appropriate algorithms for graphics design, disk scheduling, file
network routing and so on.
